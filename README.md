# CalculatorWithString
Calculator that can calculate so long number. It doesn't use number variables in this way, It can calculate up to almost infinity
Every Calculator has to have a limit. They can't get the result of so long numbers. For example;

As you can see, you can't learn the result of 3249!(Factorial). But this program;

It showed the result ! Ofcourse, to see all the result we should right click to the result;

How can it learn ? Because It doesn't use number variables. It uses only String variables. Because String variables is infinity. You can view the table of variables and features.

As you can see, all number variables has a limit. Therefore they can't contain so long number.

Also, you can check the result of my algorithm if your process isn't long for other calculators.

You can use the keyboards on the program (absolutely)


You can view my code.
